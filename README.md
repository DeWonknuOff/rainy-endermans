# Rainy Endermans

## 📖 Description

This datapack/mod adds rain hats to Enderman, allowing them to walk freely during storms without taking damage from water. Instead of fleeing at the first drop, Endermen will now roam your world wearing stylish protective hats, giving them more personality and presence. It’s a fun and immersive way to make your Minecraft world feel more alive, while keeping true to the mysterious nature of these iconic mobs.
